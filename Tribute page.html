    "The rock" played college football and was a member of the University of Miami team that won the national championship in 1991. Later, he participated in Canadian Football League games for the Calgary Stampeders before being released two months into the year. This influenced him to choose to follow in the footsteps of his father Rocky Johnson and grandfather Peter Maivia and become a professional wrestler. From 1996 to 2004, he garnered widespread recognition as a wrestler for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), formerly the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and was the first third-generation superstar in the history of the organization. As "Rocky Maivia" and later as "The Rock," a member of the Nation of Domination, Johnson received swift promotion within the WWF. He started acting in 2001 and occasionally went back into the ring. As of 2011, his acting profession is his main priority. Johnson's first leading role as an actor was in The Scorpion King in 2002. He made $5.5 million for this movie, which was the biggest salary ever paid to an actor in a leading role.
